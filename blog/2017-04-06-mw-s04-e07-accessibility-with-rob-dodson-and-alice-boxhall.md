This episode is all about web accessibility. We’re joined by Rob Dodson, developer advocate at Google, and Alice Boxhall, software engineer at Google. We talk about why accessibility matters to everyone, even beyond people with disabilities. We dive into the implementation details, such as navigation, semantics and styling, based on Rob and Alice’s Web Accessibility course. We explore various guidelines and learning resources to improve your design and implementation.
